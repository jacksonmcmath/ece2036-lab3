ECE 2036 Lab3 Test Cases
========================

Usage
-----

Copy `main.cpp` into your project folder.

In terminal or command prompt `cd` into your project directory and run the following code:

`$ g++ -c main.cpp && g++ -c vector3.cpp && g++ -o main main.o vector3.o && ./main`

I have tested this in terminal on macOS, but I have not tried this on a Windows machine (It should be pretty similar, I imagine).
If you run into trouble you can shoot me an email, and I can try to help you get it working. I'll probably just google it, though, so that's what you should do first.
